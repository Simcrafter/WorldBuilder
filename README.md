# WorldBuilder

Trying to create and simulate procedural worlds (semi) realisticly and scientifically.

Take like 2 or 3 now.

## Desired Features
* Tectonic Plate Sim to generate cylidrical planet heightmaps (use simplex noise to add variety)
* Climate Sim (based off heightmap)
  * Air Flow Circulation
  * Ocean Current Simulation
  * Generate Rainfall Map
    * Use to generate rivers
  * Tempature Sim ig
    * Albedo or smth ( T ~ (L^(1/4)) / (D^(1/2))) ) artifexian vid idk ive not done more research yet
* Tide Sim (maybe?)
* Retrograde climate sim?
* Locations of ore / mineral deposits

* Solar system Generation
  * Star formation sim
  * Planet formation sim (gas giants, tidal-locking?)
  * Build Calenders from orbits of desired planets and their moons
* Generate Atmospheres on suitable planets (composition etc)

* Simulation of Life Arising on sutible planets
* Allow user to define intelligent species that arise (incl template for common sets Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Alien Templates, DnD)
* Simulate arisal of technology
  * probably using a fixed (user modifiable) tech tree ala civ
* look at shit with culture generation
* use strategic geography to inform history simulation
